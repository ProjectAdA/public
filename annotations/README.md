# Annotation Data Sets

Throughout the project, the FU Berlin project team created a very high quality data set of manual film-analytical annotations for a set of feature films, documentaries, and television news. In the last year of the project, the annotations were supplemented by annotations that were automatically created using the extractors of the project's video analysis backend.


## All annotations as Linked Open Data (turtle files)

At the end of the project, the data sets comprised more than half a million video annotations for 391 films (including approx. 125,000 manual annotations for 49 films). These valuable annotations are published here as Linked Open Data under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license to make the data available to other film scholars as well as researchers from other domains.


## Manual annotations as Advene azp packages

In addition all manual annotations are available in the standard format of the Open-Source Annotation Software Advene (http://advene.org/) which was used to create the annotations. This folder contains the azp packages for each of the 49 manually annotated videos.

## Export Samples

This folder contains samples for two different export capabilities of the annotation explorer: 1) all manual annotations of the type "field size" throughout the corpus as csv files. 2) static html exports of different queries conducted in the annotation explorer.

# Manuals

The AdA project developed manuals and working papers that constitute together the film-studies-based analysis framework. "The Manual: Annotating with Advene and the AdA Filmontology" provides insights into potential applications of the Advene annotation software for film and media studies. It documents the stages of analysis through corroboration with the AdA Filmontology, an eMAEX based analysis vocabulary developed within the project.
An overview of this machine-readable linked open data vocabulary is presented in "AdA-Filmontology â€“ Levels, Types Values" which can serve as an annotation companion book, but also as an inspiration for the composition of other film analysis vocabularies.
The AdA Template provides this film ontology as predefined vocabulary for video annotation in Advene.
The working paper "Notes on collaborative annotation with the AdA Filmontology" provides specific suggestions for concrete usage of the AdA Filmontology in project contexts where several analysts are working simultaneously with an extensive film corpus they wish to describe consistently (so far only available in German).

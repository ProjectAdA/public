# Annotation Data Sets

Throughout the project, the FU Berlin project team created a very high quality data set of manual film-analytical annotations for a set of feature films, documentaries, and television news. In the last year of the project, the annotations were supplemented by annotations that were automatically created using the extractors of the project's video analysis backend. At the end of the project, the data sets comprised more than half a million video annotations for 391 films (including approx. 125,000 manual annotations for 49 films). These valuable annotations are published here as Linked Open Data under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license to make the data available to other film scientists as well as researchers from other domains.
